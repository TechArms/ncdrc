<h2>Network Security Lab</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>To infuse an investigative spirit even among cyber students or researches and motivates them to take up various challenging technologies.</p>
<p>Our data center proposal is engineered to offer a superior infrastructure for continuous Internet operations. NCDRC has invested in its facilities and network infrastructure to ensure continuous availability, reliability and scalability. NCDRC utilizes mission critical research lab planned applications for over 200 of the India’s best-known collages from multiple locations. We bought a range of cyber research options from cages to labs, with ample power and bandwidth for our Network core applications.</p>

<h3>Basic requirements</h3>
<p></p>

<h3></h3>
<p>Extensive Wireless, Internet and intranet connectivity exposes the cyber students and researches to the advanced information. Please refer attached BoM.</p>
<p>Core and Lab Network infrastructure:</p>
<p>Server Co-location helps us to maintain intellectual property in a safe, secure, quality controlled environment. Keeping these servers in good shape is not enough – We have to guarantee the security of the data and applications using with an efficient firewall. Core Network Firewall security solution that prevents unauthorized access into NCDRC core servers.</p>

<h3>Proposed activities</h3>
<p>Consideration of enterprise architecture is important when deploying Research Network. It focuses on understanding the overall IT security, the Cyber Defence Research project have a strong behavioral element, addressing the measurement, modeling and Visualization-virtualization of cyber-humanoid security.</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>Often in class room, we cover only details of one topic at a time. In the Cyber Defence research lab setting, students can apply multiple concepts at the same time.</p>
<p>Enable students to improve their understanding of the range of Information/cyber security problems faced by government and business</p>
<p>Encourage leading collages/classes in Information security to work together.</p>

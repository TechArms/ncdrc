<h2> IoT Security Research Lab</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>IoT or internet of things is the latest cutting edge technology and is expected to play a major role in the lives of human beings. It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 50 billion devices connected to the internet.</p>
<p>This huge volume of devices will naturally lead to a major issue with security, and it becomes very essential to have a strong secure network built around these devices to prevent crackers from compromising systems.</p>
<p>Unlike comprising banks and credit cards, weak IoT systems can compromise entire cities and also defense, or infrastructure.</p>
<p>It is very essential that we need to develop a strong force who will safeguard our IoT related development from crackers.</p>


<h3>Basic requirements</h3>
<p>To get a good knowledge on IoT, it is essential for a student to have a good knowledge on the following,</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sensors and their applications.</li>
    <li>Communication models like WiFi, blue tooth, Zigbee, Z-wave etc.</li>
    <li>Data collection and analysis.</li>
    <li>Security aspects of IoT networks.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lab infrastructure</h3>
<p>It is proposed to set up a comprehensive lab with facilities as mentioned in the excel sheet. Each lab can seat upto a maximum of 10 students per batch.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Proposed activities</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Research on developing “SMART” and secure IoT use cases for Government, Business and Consumer markets focusing on Sensors, microcontrollers, communication protocols and data bases with cloud integration.</li>
    <li>Provide a “hands on” lab environment for students and industry professionals to work on IoT and embedded projects, both existing and new in addition to conducting security exercises on the IoT networks.</li>
    <li>Providing advanced training- in house and onsite- on IoT and embedded systems using microcontrollers like,
        <ul>
            <li>Arduino</li>
            <li>8051 core</li>
            <li>PIC</li>
            <li>Raspberry PI</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Conducting periodic Arduino and Raspberry Pi Hackathon’s for educational and software development purposes. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>Students will learn to program using the various microcontrollers and communication modules. The exercises will start from simple LED’s to complex projects using Robotics and cloud integration</p>
<p>They will also learn to test the security aspects of each module they build, identify vulnerabilities and patch them accordingly.</p>
<p>Each exercise will be detailed in terms of schematic diagrams, BOM, code, and expected outputs.</p>

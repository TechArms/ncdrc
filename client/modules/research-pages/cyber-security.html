	<!-- <h3>Introduction</h3> -->
	<p>Cyber forensics is the emerging technology and is expected to play a major role in the lives of human beings. It is expected that by 2020 there will be more than 50 billion devices connected to the internet.</p>
	<p>This huge volume of devices will naturally lead to a major issue with security, and it becomes very essential to have a strong secure network built around these devices to prevent crackers from compromising systems and it’s essential to make a forensic way to trace the problems.</p>
	<p>Unlike comprising banks and credit cards, weak Network systems can compromise entire cities and also defense, or infrastructure.</p>
	<p>It is very essential that we need to develop a strong force that will safeguard our cyber world related development from crackers.</p>

</ul>
	<!-- <h3>Basic requirements</h3>
	<p>To get a good knowledge on Cyber forensics, it is essential for a student to have a good knowledge on the following,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Internet Protocols.</li>
		<li>Communication ways in cyber world.</li>
		<li>Data collection and analysis.</li>
		<li>Computer Security aspects.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Lab infrastructure</h3>
	<p>It is proposed to set up a comprehensive lab with facilities as mentioned in the excel sheet. Each lab can seat up to a maximum of 10 students per batch.</p>

	<h3>Proposed activities</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>To create a secure cyber ecosystem in the country, generate adequate trust and confidence in IT system and transactions in cyberspace.</li>
		<li>To provide fiscal benefit to businesses for adoption of standard security practices and processes.</li>
		<li>To enable effective prevention, investigation and prosecution of cybercrime and enhancement of law enforcement capabilities through appropriate legislative intervention.</li>
		<li>Provide a “hands on” lab environment for students and industry professionals to work on Cyber field and embedded projects, both existing and new in addition to conducting security exercises on the cyber forensics.</li>
		<li>Providing  advanced training- in house and onsite- on cyber forensics  using Software and Hardware’s like,
			<ul>
				<li>WinHex</li>
				<li>FTK</li>
				<li>Write Blocker</li>
				<li>Operating Systems</li>
			</ul>

		</li>
		<li>Conducting periodic CTF and Hackathon’s for educational and software development purposes. </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Exercises</h3>
	<p>Students will learn to program using the various software’s and Hardware modules. The exercises will start from simple programming to complex projects using Server and Mobiles.</p>
	<p>They will also learn to test the security aspects of each module they build, identify vulnerabilities and patch them accordingly.</p>
	<p>Each exercise will be detailed in terms of schematic diagrams, Flow Charts, Live demos,etc.</p>

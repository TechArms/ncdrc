	<h2>Web Application Security Research Lab</h2>
	<hr/>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Over the past decade or so, the web has been embraced by millions of businesses as an inexpensive channel to communicate and exchange information with prospects and transactions with customers.</p>

	<p>Attacks on Web applications are increasing at a rapid pace. As, per a report from the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), the number of successful Web application attacks is on the rise, from around 60% in 2013 to 80% in 2014. If Web application infringements continue to grow at this rate, customers’ confidence in online commerce will further diminish. Attacks focused on exploiting vulnerabilities and design flaws that frequently plague many of today's Web-based applications is growing exponentially and organizations that fail to test for and address these issues often fall victim to costly compromises.</p>

	<h3>Basic requirements</h3>
	<p>To get a good knowledge on Web Application Security, it is essential for a student to have a good or basic knowledge and interest on the following,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>How Web Application works</li>
		<li>Scripting abilities or the desire to gain them</li>
		<li>Basic Web Application Security</li>
		<li>Knowledge about Web Technologies. </li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Lab infrastructure</h3>
	<p>It is proposed to set up a comprehensive lab with facilities as mentioned in the excel sheet. Each lab can seat upto a maximum of 10 students per batch.</p>

	<h3>Proposed activities</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Research on developing “Web Applications” and secure Web Applications use cases for Government, Business and Consumer markets focusing on online marketers to get to know the people visiting their sites and start communicating with them.</li>
		<li>Provide a “hands on” lab environment for students and industry professionals to work on Web Application security projects, both existing and new in addition to conducting security exercises on the Web Applications.</li>
		<li>Providing  advanced training- in house and onsite- on Web Application Security with different web technologies,

			<ul>
				<li>Static Web Applications </li>
				<li>Dynamic Web Applications</li>
				<li>E-Commerce Web Applications  </li>
				<li>Service orientated Web Applications. </li>

			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Conducting periodic Vulnerability assessments and Penetration Testers and identification of all vulnerabilities, their actual risk level and detailed recommendations to remediate them.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Exercises</h3>
	
		<p>Students will learn to program and secure the Web Applications using the various methodologies and tools. The exercises will start from Web Application Vulnerability assessments and understanding of different Web Application Vulnerability.</p>
		<p>They will also learn to test the security aspects of each Web Applications they build or with the project given and identify vulnerabilities and report them accordingly</p>
		<p>Each exercise will be detailed in terms of Vulnerability present, POC (proof of concept) and well documented report with proper POC.</p>

        Starting from the Stone Age, it has always been human psyche to protect itself from external threats. The ideas, tricks and the methodology of protection from evil and intruding threat factors have also evolved over the time. Initially we, the humans, had to guard ourselves from physical threats like invaders and the looters. Nowadays, with the rising popularity of cyber connectivity and worldwide interlinking, the evil has also evolved in the form of breach of cyber security. It is a virtual world we have created and we have to be well prepared to protect and sustain our virtual world from the virtual invaders. I am really happy to learn that the National Cyber Safety & Security Standards is thinking about the possible solutions and establishing norms against Cyber Crimes.

        The Cyber World has been created by computers and computer networks. The internet which is an electronic communications network that connects computer networks and organizational computer facilities around the world is an interactive tool for instant access of information and knowledge on nearly every subject. The web has created the super express highway of communication and infotainment connecting every part of the globe which, in turn, has made the concept of Global Village a virtual reality.

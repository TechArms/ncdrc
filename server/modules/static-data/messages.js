	desc: '<p> Starting from the stone age, it has always been human psyche to protect itself from external threats. The ideas, tricks and the methodology of protection from evil and intruding threat factors have also evolved over the time. Initially we, the humans, had to guard ourselves from physical threats like invaders and the looters. Nowadays, with the rising popularity of cyber connectivity and worldwide interlinking, the evil has also evolved in the form of breach of cyber security. It is a virtual world we have created and we have to be well prepared to protect and sustain our virtual world from the virtual invaders. I am really happy to learn that the National Cyber Safety & Security Standards is thinking about the possible solutions and establishing norms against cyber crimes by the means of publication of National Cyber Crime Reference Handbook. </p> \
	<p>I hope the Handbook will establish and convey the most effective ways and means of protecting our national security against the worst sort of cyber attacks and provide the best safe guards against the cyber criminals threatening our nation and its integrity. </p> \
	<p>I wish all the success to the National Cyber Safety and Security Standards in its crusade to protect the nation. </p>'
